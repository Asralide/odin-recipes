    <h2>What's the deal with Jambalaya?</h2>

    <p>Jambalaya was a favorite food of mine growing up, and was a consistent staple in what my grandma would make for dinner. Just good creole/cajun cooking.</p>

    <p>A nice, simple, one-pot rice dish involving vegetables, spices, seafood, and other meats like sausage. It's perfect for making up meals for a week, and is incredibly versatile, along with being a dish with a ton of history.</p>
